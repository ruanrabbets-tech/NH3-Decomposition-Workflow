# NH3-Decomposition-Workflow
Automated density functional theory (DFT) workflow for screening first-row transition metal catalysts for ammonia decomposition.

This workflow integrates Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) in Python, providing a reproducible and extensible framework for:

Bulk unit cell relaxation

Slab creation and adsorbate setup

Adsorption energy evaluation

It was developed as part of a final-year B.Eng. Chemical Engineering research project at the University of Pretoria (2025).
